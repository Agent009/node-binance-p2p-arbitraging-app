# Binance P2P Arbitraging App

Very simple arbitrage.

* Uses the [api.exchangerate.host](https://exchangerate.host/) service for calculating the exchange rates between the buy and sell currency,
* And the [Binance P2P API](https://p2p.binance.com/) for converting between the buy and sell currency.

# Setup

Copy or rename the `.env.sample` file to `.env`, and change the defaults as needed.

Then, run `npm run start` or `npm run nodemon` (rebuilds automatically on changes).
